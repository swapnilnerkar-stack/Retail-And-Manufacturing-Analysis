🚴** Adventure Works Sales Analytics **

📊 Project Overview: This project involves end-to-end data analysis of the Adventure Works Cycles company, a global bicycle manufacturing and retail brand. The core objective is to derive actionable insights from historical sales data to help the company improve its revenue, market share, and product focus. I have created interactive dashboards using Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, backed by data cleaning in Excel and metric extraction using SQL.

📈 Key Insights Generated

🔹 Overall Performance: Total Sales: ₹29.36M, Total Orders: 27,659, Total Customers: 18,484, Total Profit: ₹12.08M

🔹 Product-Level Insights: Bikes dominate revenue — ₹28.32M out of ₹29.36M. Clothing and Accessories generate minimal revenue (< ₹1M combined). Focused marketing on top sub-categories like Road Bikes and Mountain Bikes is crucial (together >80% of product sales).

🔹 Customer Segmentation: Customers with ₹60K–₹80K yearly income contribute the most to sales (~₹11.11M). Female customers make up slightly higher sales than males (50.46% vs 49.54%).

🔹 Regional Performance: United States and Australia are top markets with >₹9M in sales each. Other countries like the UK, Germany, France, and Canada lag behind.

💡 Recommendations to Boost Sales

Product Focus: Invest more in expanding the bike sub-categories that are high-performing (e.g., Road Bikes, Mountain Bikes). Re-evaluate inventory of low-selling products like Helmets and Tires.

Customer Targeting: Prioritize the ₹60K–₹80K income group with customized offers. Segment promotions by gender as both have nearly equal purchase behavior.

Regional Strategy: Double down on strong markets (US, Australia). Launch regional campaigns to improve sales in Europe and Canada.

Category Optimization: Consider bundling accessories with bike sales to improve underperforming categories. Phase out or redesign clothing lines that aren’t contributing significantly to revenue.
